# Bus-Reserve
Bus Reservation System

The project is a GUI approach to create a simple Bus Reservation System through Java programming.

The project is made by using Abstract Window Toolkit(AWT) frames and inserting the components in it. The project also consists of the Database Management System using PostgresDB. You can use any other DB like MySQL, Oracle etc. It will all work the same.

The project source code can properly show in NetBeans IDE. You just have to download it and paste it in the Documents/NetBeansProjects folder and start the program or if you want to see the code in action, we have also included a .jar file(BusReserve.jar) which will start wherever you keep it, just make sure the files are in the same folder.

Any new additions to the project will be greatly appreciated.
